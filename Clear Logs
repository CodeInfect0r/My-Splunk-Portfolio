This repository is where I’m documenting my process of creating a Splunk dashboard focused on cyber defensive monitoring.

One of the use cases I’m working on is detecting when Windows security logs are cleared, which could be a sign of malicious activity or tampering.
Example Use Case: Log Clearing Detection

I'm using the following SPL query to create a chart that shows events where the Windows Security log has been cleared:

* host=insertHere source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="1102"

This query searches for Event Code 1102, which indicates that the audit log was cleared on a Windows system. I plan to use this in a time chart panel to track when and where these events occur across hosts.

As I build more panels and add more queries, I’ll update the documentation here.
