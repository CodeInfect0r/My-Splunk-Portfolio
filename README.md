This repository is where I document my process of creating a Splunk dashboard for cyber defensive monitoring.

The goal is to track and detect suspicious activity using log data from different sources. I will be writing down steps, notes, and any helpful information I learn along the way.

I will also include example SPL queries, dashboard panels, and details about how I set up data inputs. This is mainly for learning and reference, but it may help others who are working on similar projects.

As I continue building, Iâ€™ll update the repository with more examples and improvements.
